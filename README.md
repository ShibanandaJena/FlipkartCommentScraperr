# FlipkartCommentScraperr

I also worked on a web scrapping app  where when the user gives input a 
product name of their desire , the algorithm will select the 1 st product that we asked for ,
from the Flipkart app and then it will scrap all the (ratings + reviews) , 
shown in the 1 st page of the product description. It is a basic web scrapping app where I used flask as backend .
I also learned few good things about flask. It is a easy and smooth framework.
